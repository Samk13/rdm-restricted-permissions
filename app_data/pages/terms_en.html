              This service provides a platform for documenting and sharing data. KTH's
              employees, students, and external partners can collaborate and manage
              access to different types of data at varying levels of access. All systems
              and services provided by KTH must be used in accordance with current
              regulations, including guidelines, rules, and current legislation. Failure
              to comply with these regulations may result in a user being banned from
              the system. All users of this service must also agree to KTH's liability
              agreement. Users are responsible for following the general rules for the

              Confidential information is information that, if publicly disclosed, poses
              a risk of harm to KTH or individuals. Confidential information should not
              be made publicly available but may be shared within a restricted community
              if a risk assessment has concluded that this is in line with acceptable
              risk. See instructions for information security at KTH

              If you are uncertain whether material collected as raw data in a research
              project is confidential material or what access level is appropriate,
              contact researchdata@kth.se for advice.

              When you create an account for this service, KTH processes your personal
              data in accordance with Swedish legislation and the General Data
              Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the EU. To close your account, contact KTH
              at dataskyddsombud@kth.se, and you will then be removed from the user
              register. If you have entered your name and optionally an ORCID when
              making a dataset available, the name and optional ID will remain in the
              system, as publishing information of your name corresponds to the author
              declaration on publication and where KTH, as the responsible publisher,
              cannot withdraw that published information.

              KTH is the data controller for personal data included in data processed in
              KTH's research activities, but personal data processing may be regulated
              in an agreement with an external party. If an external party uses this
              service to submit datasets containing personal information to a restricted
              community, they must have an established agreement with KTH that regulates
              the processing of personal data. In this agreement, KTH can either act as
              a personal data processor or as one of the parties where joint personal
              data processing is regulated. Personal data collected in research should
              not be made publicly available unless explicit consent has been obtained
              from the subjects whose personal data is being collected. The handling of
              personal data is subject to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
              in the EU and may also be subject to other data protection laws depending
              on the jurisdiction of the external party. Details of this is handled in
              the specific agreement with the external party. For further information
              regarding a specific agreement you should contact
              <b>avtal@kth.se</b>
