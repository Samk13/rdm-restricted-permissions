          <h1>Creating a Restricted Record</h1>
          <p>
            This service offers a functionality to create records with restricted
            access. This feature allows data curators and administrators to limit the
            visibility of certain records, making them accessible only to authorized
            users. In this guide, we'll outline the process to create a restricted
            record.
          </p>
          <p>
            A restricted record is a record that contains sensitive or confidential
            information, and is not publicly accessible. Restricted records can be
            useful in cases where you want to provide access to certain information or
            resources to only a select group of users or organizations.
