          <p>
            KTH-RDM facilitates the easy sharing of records with colleagues and
            collaborators. In this guide, we'll walk you through the process of sharing
            a record with other users.
          </p>

          <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>You should be logged in.</li>
            <li>A record you own that you want to share.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Steps to Share a Record</h2>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <h3>Access your Record</h3>
              <p>
                From your dashboard or records list, locate and click on your record you
                wish to share.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h3>Locate the Sharing Option</h3>
              <p>
                Within the record's detailed view, find the 'Share'under edit and new
                version buttons on the right of the screen.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h3>Share the link</h3>
              <p>
                Upon clicking the 'Share' button, a modal should appear "Get a link"
                providing a direct link to your record. Press Get link, wait a second,
                then the link generated will be copied automatically.
              </p>
            </li>

            <div class="ui info message">
              <div class="header">Note</div>
              <p>
                There are three type of permission in the link generated (Can view, Can
                preview, Can edit)
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Can view: Anyone with this link can view all versions of this record &
                  files.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Can preview: Anyone with this link can view all published and
                  unpublished versions of this record & files.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Can edit: Anyone with an account and this link can edit all versions
                  of this record & files.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Ensure that the record's permissions allow the shared users to view or
                edit it as intended. You might need to adjust the record's visibility or
                access settings accordingly.

                Share the copied link with your colleagues, collaborators, or any
                intended recipients. They can access the record directly using this link
                and the permissions you set for the link.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Link deletion</h3>
              <p>
                You can delete the link at any time and whom you shared the link with
                will no longer be able to access the record
