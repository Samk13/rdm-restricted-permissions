          <p>
            KTH.se/namn is a platform for documenting and sharing data. Here, KTH's
            employees, students, and external collaborators can together document,
            version control, and make different types of data available at different
            levels of access. All systems and services provided by KTH should be used in
            accordance with applicable regulations. This means that guidelines, rules,
            and laws should be followed for the data that is stored and made available
            via KTH.se/namn. If this is not followed and you misbehave, you may be
            suspended from the systems.
          </p>
          <p>
            What is stated in the liability agreement that all KTH account holders sign
            also applies to the use of KTH.se/namn. As a user, you are responsible for
            following the general rules for using KTH's systems that are outlined in the
            liability agreement.

          </p>
          <p>
            KTH.se/namn is a support tool for KTH's operations, which include education,
            research, support activities, and union activities. Below is more detailed
            information specific to KTH.se/namn.
          </p>
          <p>
            Responsibility - the creator of a community is responsible for the content.
          </p>
          <p>
            The purpose of communities in namn is to facilitate data sharing in
            collaborations within KTH's areas of operation, as well as to document and
            make data available within the operations. KTH.se/namn may not be used for
            private purposes. Communities may only be made public after risk assessment,
            for example, in connection with a data management plan for research, and
            where the material shared within the community has been assessed as
            appropriate for open data sharing.
          </p>
          <p>
            The person who creates a community and holds the role of community manager
            is responsible for data management within the community. The guidelines for
            handling data in research activities are described in more detail in KTH's
            Guideline for research data management.
            <a

            your research group leader or KTH's Data Protection Officer for guidance.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a community manager, it is your responsibility to ensure that the data
            within your community is shared at the appropriate access level. KTH.se/namn
            offers different access levels for data sharing, and you should choose the
            one that best suits the type of data being shared.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is important to note that KTH reserves the right to remove any material
            that violates Swedish archive legislation. Additionally, any confidential
            information that may cause harm to KTH or individuals should not be made
            public on KTH.se/namn.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are unsure whether the data collected as raw material in research
            projects is confidential, please consult your research group leader or KTH's
            Data Protection Officer for guidance.researchdata@kth.se for advice. Often,
            confidential data can be shared within a project group with limited access
            in accordance with any contractual agreements, even if it is not appropriate
            for it to be fully publicly available.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, it is not permitted to make material publicly available that
            may result in:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Disclosure of public documents covered by secrecy under the Public Access
              to Information and Secrecy Act (2009:400)
            </li>
            <li>Disclosure of classified information</li>
            <li>
              Disclosure of personal data where a risk assessment has shown that it
              poses risks to the individual's privacy to spread it publicly
            </li>
            <li>
              Unauthorized use and distribution of copyrighted material or related
              rights
            </li>
            <li>KTH.se/name is not suitable for classified information.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Information that cannot be made publicly available can in most cases be
            shared with limited access within a limited group of authorized persons
            within a community in KTH.se/name.
          </p>
          <p>
            In some cases, there are reasons for confidentiality, where it is the
            community manager who assesses who has authorization to access the data
            shared within a community with limited access. The community manager is
            responsible for adding only those who should have access to the data as
            members of the community with limited access.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you, for any reason, want to increase the visibility of data that has
            been documented and made available within a community, you should first
            contact the community manager for this within the community where the data
            has been made available. In the second instance, you can contact
            researchdata@kth.se The levels available are as follows:
          </p>
          <p>At the dataset level:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Full public visibility - anyone can search for and download the data files
            </li>
            <li>
              Restricted access for downloading files - only members of the community
              have access. However, the description of the content is searchable for the
              public.
            </li>
            <li>
              Restricted access for both downloading files and limited access and
              searchability for the descriptions of the files. The content in the
              dataset description is only searchable and available for download by
              members of the community.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>At the community level:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Full public visibility - anyone can search for and download the data files
            </li>
            <li>Restricted access - only members of the community have access</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            It is also possible to make a dataset description available without storing
            the data files described in connection with KTH.se/namn.
          </p>
          <p>
            System administrators at KTH have access to data regardless of the
            accessibility level, but will only use this authority in accordance with the
            responsibility commitment for system administrators at KTH.
            <a
              href="https://intra.kth.se/polopoly_fs/1.662185.1562824393!/ansvar_skyldigheter_systemadministrat%C3%B6r.pdf"

            >
            Remember that KTH, as a state authority, is subject to the principle of
            public access to official documents. This means that material found on
            KTH.se/namn may constitute public documents, which must be disclosed upon
            request to access public documents unless otherwise provided by secrecy
            provisions.
          </p>
          <h2>Copyright</h2>
          <p>
            Copyright must be respected by all users. You should not upload copyrighted
            material where someone else holds the copyright unless you have the
            copyright holder's permission. In the event that a work has several authors,
            whose contributions cannot be distinguished as independent works, the
            copyright belongs jointly to the authors. KTH.se/namn specifies the CC-BY
            4.0 license as the basis when you make a dataset available, which means that
            anyone can use the material freely as long as the copyright holder is cited.
            It is also possible to choose other licenses in accordance with KTH's
            guidelines. For more information, see KTH's guidelines for intellectual
            assets.

          <h2>Processing of personal data</h2>
          <p>
            When you create an account on KTH.se/namn, KTH processes your personal data.
            You can contact KTH at xxxx to terminate your account. If you provide your
            name and possibly ORCID when making a dataset available, your name will
            remain in the system even if you terminate your account and other personal
            data processing, as it corresponds to author attribution in publishing and
            where KTH, as the responsible publisher, has the right/obligation to state
            this.
          </p>
          <p>
            KTH is usually the data controller. If an external party uses KTH.se/namn to
            make datasets with restricted access containing personal data available,
            there must be an agreement between the external party and KTH where KTH can
            be a data processor or data controller, or one of the parties where joint
            processing of personal data is regulated in the agreement.
          </p>
          <p>
            I hereby certify that I have read and understood the above terms and accept
            that as a community manager, I am responsible for ensuring that the data
            uploaded to the communities I am responsible for has been made available in
            accordance with the terms and conditions. Please note that the terms of use
            may be subject to change - you will be informed of any changes in the terms.
          </p>
          <p>
            For external users, fees for use may be charged in the event of changes to
            the terms of use in the future.
